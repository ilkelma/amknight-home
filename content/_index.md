        Welcome to my personal/professional site!
      </p>
      <p>
        I primarily have information related to my work here including my tech blog <a href="/posts">2b || !2b</a> and links to my <a href="https://cv.amknight.com"> CV (NYI)</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The site itself can be found <a href="https://www.github.com/ilkelma">here</a> on <a href="https://www.github.com/ilkelma">my github</a> including (coming soon) ansible configs to build it from scratch.
